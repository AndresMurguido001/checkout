# Angular Checkout

This is a simple checkout implemented with angular. Currently a work in progress. The goal was to create an interactive form that guides the user towards completion with different animations. It also uses a nested form structure to contain everything in one form with nested form groups.

To run this code yourself simply clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/AndresMurguido001/checkout.git
cd checkout
npm start
```
